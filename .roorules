# Technical Details

- Use `bun` as the package manager
- Use `bunx` to execute remote packages
- Use `shadcn/ui` as the UI solution
- Never touch `src/routeTree.gen.ts`, it's a generated file
- Use drizzle for the database
- Use better-auth for authentication solution

# Code Style

- Prefer function definition instead of arrow function declaration
- Use this syntax whenever starting a new page / route
```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/path")({
	component: XXXPage,
});

function XXXPage() {
	return (
		<div>
			Content
		</div>
	);
}
```
