AI chat client because I don't like existing ones.

## Why

- I don't like monthly subscription since I don't use them religiously, token-based approach saved me a lot of money
- I want to be able to choose my own custom models
- I want a simple and fast app without a lot of features I won't need
- I want an app that I can use from both my computer and my phone, which is why it's a PWA
- I basically want RooCode for general use, where it can switch modes, I like the orchestration pattern a lot
- I want a chat app that I can write my own modes and define tools for that mode
- I want a web chat app that supports remote MCP use, cloudflare ai agents type of thing
- I want it to be easily deployed on serverless services, a lot of existing solutions requires a server, I'm too broke for that stuff
- because it's fun??? this is just yet another side project

## How to use

You need to self-host this yourself, I designed it to be single user only because I don't want to deal with securely storing user's API key. Remember, this thing is BYOK.

Thankfully, it's super easy to do!

## Contributing

I appreciate that (though tbf i highly doubt if there's anyone who wants to :p) but I'm probably going to reject most of your ideas because this project is reaaallllly opinionated and tailored to myself, I don't want to maintain stuff that I won't use.
I encourage you to just fork this if you want to add your own stuff.

I just put the code here because idk maybe it can also be useful for someone else? who knows
